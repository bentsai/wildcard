# Wildcard

Wildcard is a platform that empowers anyone to build browser extensions and modify websites to meet their own specific needs.

Wildcard shows a simplified view of the data in a web page as a familiar table view. People can directly manipulate the table to sort/filter content, add annotations, and even use spreadsheet-style formulas to pull in data from other websites.

## Install Wildcard

Be aware: Wildcard is still pre-release software.

**The current master branch is stable, but missing a few important features
that have yet to be ported over from previous versions of the codebase: mainly filtering the table and formulas.**
