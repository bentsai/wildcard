## Install Wildcard

Note: this project is in alpha status. Install at your own risk and don't be surprised by bugs and breaking changes. ðŸš§

First, clone this repo locally: `git clone https://github.com/geoffreylitt/wildcard.git`

**To install on Chrome**: [Follow these instructions](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#manifest) to install the cloned directory as an unpacked Chrome extension.

**To install on Edge**: [Follow these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/extensions-chromium/getting-started/part1-simple-extension#run-your-extension-locally-in-your-browser-while-developing-it-side-loading) to install the cloned directory as an unpacked Edge extension.

To test whether it's working: try an [Airbnb search](https://www.airbnb.com/s/Miami/homes?checkin=2019-11-14&checkout=2019-11-17&adults=1&children=0&infants=0&place_id=ChIJEcHIDqKw2YgRZU-t3XHylv8&refinement_paths%5B%5D=%2Fhomes&search_type=section_navigation); the table should appear at the bottom and you should be able to sort by price. (You may need to refresh the page once to get the table to appear)

## Contribute to Wildcard

If you want to make changes to Wildcard, here are instructions for setting up Wildcard's development environment locally.

Wildcard is built in Typescript and uses yarn and rollup for packages and bundling.

[View code documentation on Github](https://geoffreylitt.github.io/wildcard/)

### Initial setup

Install dependencies:

* install [yarn](https://legacy.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) and [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/)
* `yarn install`
* `yarn global add concurrently`

Follow these steps to get code changes to automatically update the extension:

* Install the [Chrome Extension AutoReload](https://github.com/JeromeDane/chrome-extension-auto-reload) as an unpacked extension from source.
* From the `chrome://extensions` page, click Details -> Extension Options, and change the Reload Method to "Manage API".

### Dev workflow

Every time you develop, follow these steps.

* `yarn run dev` to start a watcher that compiles the project and updates the Chrome extension
* Compilation can take a few seconds. If a change isn't working, it might be that compilation didn't finish yet. (Improving compilation time is a todo; I think it's mostly time spent compiling Handsontable)

To test if you're able to make changes, try adding a `console.log` statement to a site adapter file like `src/site_adapters/airbnb.ts` and see if it works.

### Documentation

Documentation for the Wildcard Core is built with [Typedoc](http://typedoc.org/).
It has helpful information for e.g. building site adapters.

* [View docs for the master branch online](https://geoffreylitt.github.io/wildcard/) (hosted on Github pages from the docs directory here)
* To regenerate docs from the code, run `yarn docs`.
* To view docs locally, open `docs/index.html`.

## Understanding the codebase

### Background

It helps to understand the basic ideas of React + Redux to understand this codebase. Some good introductions:

* https://redux.js.org/introduction/core-concepts
* https://redux.js.org/basics/data-flow
* https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html

The code is split into three main modules, each with their own directory inside `src`. Here's a quick overview of the contents of each module.

#### Core

Maintains system state. Defines Redux actions and reducers.

#### Site adapters

#### UI
